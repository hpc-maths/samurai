The use of mesh adaptation methods in numerical simulation allows to drastically reduce the memory footprint and the computational costs. There are different kinds of methods: AMR patch-based, AMR cell-based, multiresolution cell-based or point-based, ...

Different open source software is available to the community to manage mesh adaptation: [AMReX](https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/) for patch-based AMR, [p4est](https://www.p4est.org/) and [pablo](https://optimad.github.io/PABLO/) for cell-based adaptation.

The strength of samurai is that it allows to implement all the above mentioned mesh adaptation methods from the same data structure. The mesh is represented as intervals and a set algebra allows to efficiently search for subsets among these intervals.
Samurai also offers a flexible and pleasant interface to easily implement numerical methods.

## Get started

In this section, we propose two examples: the first one solves a 2D advection equation with mesh adaptation using multiresolution, the second one shows the use of set algebra on intervals.

### The advection equation

We want to solve the 2D advection equation given by

$$
\partial_t u + a \cdot \nabla u = 0 \\; \text{in} \\; [0, 1]\times [0, 1]
$$

with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and $a = (1, 1)$. The initial solution is given by

$$
u_0(x, y) = \left\\{
\begin{align*}
1 & \\; \text{in} \\; [0.4, 0.6]\times [0.4, 0.6], \\
0 & \\; \text{elsewhere}.
\end{align*}
\right.
$$

To solve this equation, we use the well known [upwind scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwind_scheme).

The following steps describe how to solve this problem with samurai. It is important to note that these steps are generally the same whatever the equations we want to solve.

- Define the configuration of the problem

    ```cpp
    constexpr size_t dim = 2;
    using Config = samurai::MRConfig<dim>;
    std::size_t min_level = 2, max_level = 8;
    ````

- Create the Cartesian mesh

    ```cpp
    const samurai::Box<double, dim> box({0., 0.}, {1., 1.});
    samurai::MRMesh<Config> mesh(box, min_level, max_level);
    ```

- Create the field on this mesh

    ```cpp
    auto u = samurai::make_field<double, 1>("u", mesh);
    samurai::make_bc<samurai::Dirichlet>(u, 0.);
    ```

- Initialization of this field

    ```cpp
    samurai::for_each_cell(mesh, [&](const auto& cell)
    {
        double length = 0.2;
        if (xt::all(xt::abs(cell.center() - 0.5) <= 0.5*length))
        {
            u[cell] = 1;
        }
    });
    ````

- Create the adaptation method

    ```cpp
    auto MRadaptation = samurai::make_MRAdapt(u);
    ```

- Time loop

    ```cpp
    double dx = samurai::cell_length(max_level);
    double dt = 0.5*dx;
    auto unp1 = samurai::make_field<double, 1>("u", mesh);

    // Time loop
    for (std::size_t nite = 0; nite < 50; ++nite)
    {
        // adapt u
        MRadaptation(1e-4, 2);

        // update the ghosts used by the upwind scheme
        samurai::update_ghost_mr(u);

        // upwind scheme
        samurai::for_each_interval(mesh, [&](std::size_t level, const auto& i, const auto& index)
        {
            double dx = samurai::cell_length(level);
            auto j = index[0];

            unp1(level, i, j) = u(level, i, j) - dt / dx * (u(level, i, j) - u(level, i - 1, j)
                                                          + u(level, i, j) - u(level, i, j - 1));
        });

        std::swap(unp1.array(), u.array());
    }
    ```

The whole example can be found [here](./demos/FiniteVolume/advection_2d.cpp).

### The projection operator

When manipulating grids of different resolution levels, it is often necessary to transmit the solution of a level $l$ to a level $l+1$ and vice versa. We are interested here in the projection operator defined by

$$
u(l, i, j) = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{k_i=0}^1\sum_{k_j=0}^1 u(l+1, 2i + k_i, 2j + k_j)
$$

This operator allows to compute the cell-average value of the solution at a grid node at level $l$ from cell-average values of the solution known on children-nodes at grid level $l + 1$ for a 2D problem.

We assume that we already have a samurai mesh with several level defined in the variable `mesh`. To access to a level, we use the operator `mesh[level]`. We also assume that we created a field on this mesh using the `make_field` and initialized it.

The following steps describe how to implement the projection operator with samurai.

- Create a subset of the mesh using set algebra
```cpp
auto set = samurai::intersection(mesh[level], mesh[level+1]).on(level);
```

- Apply an operator on this subset

```cpp
set([&](const auto& i, const auto index)
{
    auto j = index[0];
    u(level, i, j) = 0.25*(u(level+1, 2*i, 2*j)
                         + u(level+1, 2*i+1, 2*j)
                         + u(level+1, 2*i, 2*j+1)
                         + u(level+1, 2*i+1, 2*j+1));
});
```

The multi dimensional projection operator can be found [here](./include/samurai/numeric/projection.hpp).

And finally, if you have to use PETSc to assemble the matrix of your problem, you need to install it

```bash
mamba install petsc pkg-config
```

### From source

Run the cmake configuration

- With mamba or conda

    First, you need to create the environment with all the dependencies installed

    ```bash
    mamba env create --file conda/environment.yml
    mamba activate samurai-env
    ```


    ```bash
    cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_DEMOS=ON
    ```
