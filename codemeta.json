    "description": "The use of mesh adaptation methods in numerical simulation allows to drastically reduce the memory footprint and the computational costs. There are different kinds of methods: AMR patch-based, AMR cell-based, multiresolution cell-based or point-based, ...\n\nDifferent open source software is available to the community to manage mesh adaptation: AMReX for patch-based AMR, p4est and pablo for cell-based adaptation.\n\nThe strength of samurai is that it allows to implement all the above mentioned mesh adaptation methods from the same data structure. The mesh is represented as intervals and a set algebra allows to efficiently search for subsets among these intervals. Samurai also offers a flexible and pleasant interface to easily implement numerical methods.",
